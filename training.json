Today is your first day of field training, and the master will take you to one of his favorite workplaces -- a crowded urban settlement. What makes such a common place really special? A lot of people without the knowledge of information security basics, with dozens of unsecured routers and default passwords, which invite you to visit their local networks.\nYou are in a car at the urban settlement parking lot. The master brought his laptop with Kali Linux that, together with his advice, you can use in today's outdoor training. The main goal of today's training is simple: to steal anything that can be valuable."

In this case, go to the main menu in the top left corner of your attacker machine, then `Settings` and `Display` and set a lower resolution.\n\nFor this session, we strongly recommend setting up and using an SSH connection (not only the web console).\n\nWhen you are sure that you can connect to the attacker machine, submit `start` to proceed to the first training phase.\n\n**Do not enter the following answer before you have set up your access.**",
